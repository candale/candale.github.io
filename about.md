That's me up there. I'm just a regular guy with a passion for programming and building stuff with code. I started my
programming career with Progress (ABL) and switched over to Python. Since then I've been working with Django, Flask,
SQlAchemy and other goodies.

In my spare time I like biking (it's been quite a while since I've last used the bus) taking pictures of stuff but at
the end of the day I still like to play with some Atmega's, ATTiny's or ESP8266's.
